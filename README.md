# 🌿 Blockchain-Secured Ecotourism Ticketing

Welcome to a revolutionary ecotourism ticketing system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts! This project ensures that funds from ecotourism activities go directly to local conservation efforts, eliminating intermediaries and promoting transparency.

## ✨ Features

🎟️ Purchase tickets for ecotourism experiences  
🌍 Direct fund allocation to verified conservation organizations  
🔍 Transparent tracking of fund usage  
🔐 Secure ticket ownership and transferability  
✅ Verification of conservation organization legitimacy  
📊 Real-time reporting of conservation impact  
🚫 Prevention of ticket fraud and double-spending  

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Tourists**  
- Browse ecotourism experiences (e.g., guided wildlife tours, conservation workshops).  
- Purchase tickets using STX (Stacks’ native token) via the `ticket-purchase` contract.  
- Receive a unique, non-transferable ticket NFT tied to your identity.  
- Redeem tickets at the event using the `ticket-redemption` contract.  

**For Conservation Organizations**  
- Register as a verified organization through the `org-registry` contract.  
- Receive funds directly from ticket sales into a designated escrow account.  
- Provide transparent updates on fund usage via the `fund-tracking` contract.  

**For Verifiers**  
- Use the `verify-org` contract to confirm the legitimacy of conservation organizations.  
- Access the `impact-report` contract to view real-time data on conservation outcomes (e.g., hectares protected, species monitored).  

**Key Benefits**  
- Eliminates intermediaries, ensuring 100% of ticket revenue supports conservation.  
- Immutable blockchain records prevent fraud and ensure transparency.  
- Encourages trust in ecotourism by providing verifiable impact data.  

## 📜 Smart Contracts

This project uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to power the ecotourism ticketing system:

1. **ticket-purchase.clar**  
   Handles ticket purchases, calculates fees, and allocates funds to conservation organizations.  

2. **ticket-nft.clar**  
   Manages the creation and ownership of unique ticket NFTs, ensuring non-transferability unless explicitly allowed.  

3. **ticket-redemption.clar**  
   Verifies and processes ticket redemption at ecotourism events.  

4. **org-registry.clar**  
   Registers and verifies conservation organizations, storing their details and credentials.  

5. **fund-escrow.clar**  
   Manages escrow accounts for secure fund allocation to verified organizations.  

6. **fund-tracking.clar**  
   Tracks and logs how funds are spent by conservation organizations.  

7. **verify-org.clar**  
   Allows public verification of conservation organization legitimacy.  

8. **impact-report.clar**  
   Aggregates and reports conservation impact data (e.g., metrics on protected areas or species).  

## 🌟 Why This Matters
This project tackles real-world problems in ecotourism:  
- **Intermediary Fees**: Traditional ticketing platforms take significant cuts, reducing funds for conservation.  
- **Lack of Transparency**: Tourists often don’t know how their money is used.  
- **Fraud Risks**: Fake tickets or unverified organizations can erode trust.  

By leveraging the Stacks blockchain and Clarity, we ensure secure, transparent, and direct support for conservation efforts, making ecotourism a powerful force for environmental good.

## 📚 Future Enhancements
- Integration with decentralized identity for tourist verification.  
- Support for recurring donations through ticket purchases.  
- Gamification of conservation impact (e.g., badges for tourists).
